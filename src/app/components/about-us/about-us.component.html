            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        </mat-card-subtitle>
        <mat-card-content class="common-color">
            <h6 class="common-subheading">Add, Manage, and Organize Tasks:</h6> With a clean and intuitive interface,
            adding and
            organizing tasks has never
            been
            easier. You can create a new task by providing a title and description, which allows for better clarity and
            purpose.


            <h6 class="common-subheading">Connect with Me:</h6> You can easily mark tasks as done by simply checking the
            box. This allows
            you to
            track your
            progress and visualize the completion of your to-do list.


            <h6 class="common-subheading">Delete Unwanted Tasks:</h6> If a task is no longer relevant or completed, it
            can be swiftly
            deleted with a single
            click,
            keeping your task list clean and focused.


            <h6 class="common-subheading">Responsive Design:</h6> The layout of the app is fully responsive, adapting to
            different screen
            sizes and
            devices,
            ensuring an optimal user experience whether you're using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.


            <h6 class="common-subheading">Grid View for Task Management:</h6> The app utilizes a grid layout for task
            organization,
            offering a clearer,
            more
            structured view of your tasks. This grid layout makes it easy to distinguish between multiple tasks and
            ensures your
            list stays visually organized, no matter how many items are added.


            <h6 class="common-subheading">Local Storage for Data Retention:</h6> Unlike cloud-based apps, our ToDo List
            stores all your
            tasks locally on
            your
            device. This ensures that your data is private, secure, and available even without an internet connection.
            Your
            tasks will remain saved and accessible, giving you peace of mind.

            Our goal is to provide users with a functional, stylish, and reliable tool for managing everyday tasks. The
            app's
            design and performance reflect our commitment to providing an organized solution that meets the needs of
            busy
            professionals and everyday users alike.

            Thank you for choosing our ToDo List App. We hope it helps you stay productive, organized, and efficient
            throughout
            your day!
