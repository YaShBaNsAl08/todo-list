            Add, Manage, and Organize Tasks: With a clean and intuitive interface, adding and organizing tasks has never been
            easier. You can create a new task by providing a title and description, which allows for better clarity and purpose.
        
            Mark Tasks as Complete: You can easily mark tasks as done by simply checking the box. This allows you to track your
            progress and visualize the completion of your to-do list.
        
            Delete Unwanted Tasks: If a task is no longer relevant or completed, it can be swiftly deleted with a single click,
            keeping your task list clean and focused.
        
            Responsive Design: The layout of the app is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices,
            ensuring an optimal user experience whether you're using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
        
            Grid View for Task Management: The app utilizes a grid layout for task organization, offering a clearer, more
            structured view of your tasks. This grid layout makes it easy to distinguish between multiple tasks and ensures your
            list stays visually organized, no matter how many items are added.
        
            Local Storage for Data Retention: Unlike cloud-based apps, our ToDo List stores all your tasks locally on your
            device. This ensures that your data is private, secure, and available even without an internet connection. Your
            tasks will remain saved and accessible, giving you peace of mind.
        
            Our goal is to provide users with a functional, stylish, and reliable tool for managing everyday tasks. The app's
            design and performance reflect our commitment to providing an organized solution that meets the needs of busy
            professionals and everyday users alike.
        
            Thank you for choosing our ToDo List App. We hope it helps you stay productive, organized, and efficient throughout
            your day!
